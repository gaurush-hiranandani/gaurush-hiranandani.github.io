# About Me

I am a Staff Applied Scientist at [Typeface AI](https://www.typeface.ai/), where I work at the intersection of statistical machine learning and real-world applications. Prior to this role, I gained valuable experience at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) and [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), contributing to advancements in search and personalization. 

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/). Before my doctoral studies, I earned an integrated master's degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. 

My research focuses on statistical machine learning, with an emphasis on preference elicitation, personalization of large language models, recommender systems, and black-box model optimization. I am passionate about developing scalable and efficient algorithms that enhance decision-making and user experiences.

# About Me

I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student working in statistical machine learning with a focus on metric elicitation, ranking, and recommendation systems. I am advised by [Prof. Sanmi Koyejo](http://sanmi.cs.illinois.edu/). Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I worked at [Adobe Research, India](https://research.adobe.com/) for two years. I have pursued integrated masters in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/), where I began my machine learning journey with [Prof. Harish Karnick](http://www.iitk.ac.in/new/dr-harish-karnick).

# Ph.D. Research Internships

* (Summers'19) I spent summers'20 at the innovative office of [Google Research, Mountain View](https://research.google/) (remotely interned from Urbana due to Covid), where I was mentored by [Dr. Harikrishna Narasimhan](https://research.google/people/106252/) and [Dr. Mahdi Milani Fard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahdi-milani-fard-6924731a1/).
* (Summers'19) I spent summers'19 at the dynamic office of [Amazon (A9) Research, Palo Alto](https://www.aboutamazon.com/research), where I was mentored by [Dr. Nikhil Rao](https://nikrao.github.io/) and [Dr. Sumeet Katariya](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~sumeet/).
* (Summers'18) I spent summers'18 at the wonderful office of [Microsoft Research, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I was mentored by [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/) and Dr. Ayush Choure.

# Prior to Ph.D.

* (June'15-July'17) I was a member of research staff at [Adobe Research, India](https://research.adobe.com/), where I mostly worked in [Time Series Analysis](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611975321.59) and [Recommendation systems](http://auai.org/uai2019/proceedings/papers/248.pdf) and also explored many areas including [Augmented Reality](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8088451/), [Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09335), and Visualization (paper to be completed someday). However, all the projects had Machine Learning in action.

[comment]: < * (Summers'14) I spent summers'14 at [Adobe Research, India](https://research.adobe.com/), where I worked on building a (recommendation) module that inspires creative artist to initiate new art work. Due to properiotery nature of the system, publishing papers was not easy; however, we filed 2 patents from this work. >

* (Summers'13) At some point, I was really interested in Discrete Mathematics, especially, Combinatorics. For summers 2013, I got a wonderful opportunity to work with [Dr. Jean-Marc Schlenker](http://math.uni.lu/schlenker/) at the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/). Under his guidance, I published my first siginificant [work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195669815001274) in the European Journal of Combinatorics.

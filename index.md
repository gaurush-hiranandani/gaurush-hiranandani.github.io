# About Me

I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student working in Statistical Machine Learning. I am advised by [Prof. Sanmi Koyejo](http://sanmi.cs.illinois.edu/). Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I worked at [Adobe Research, India](https://research.adobe.com/) for two years. I pursued integrated masters in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) where I began my Machine Learning journey with [Prof. Harish Karnick](http://www.iitk.ac.in/new/dr-harish-karnick).

# Ph.D. Research Internships

* I spent summers'18 at the wonderful office of [Microsoft Research, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I was mentored by [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/) and Dr. Ayush Choure.

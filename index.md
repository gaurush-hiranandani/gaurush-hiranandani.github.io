# About Me

I am currently an Applied Scientist at AWS AI Labs, with over five years of industry experience as an applied/research scientist. Before this role, I gained valuable experience working with Amazon Search (A9) and [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). 

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed an integrated master's degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. My research primarily focuses on statistical machine learning, particularly in the areas of preference elicitation, personalization of large language models, recommender systems, and optimization.

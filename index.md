# About Me

I am currently an Applied Scientist at AWS AI Labs, with over five years of industry experience as applied/research scientist. Before this role, I gained valuable experience working with Amazon Search (A9) and [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed an integrated master's degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. My research primarily focuses on statistical machine learning, particularly in the areas of preference elicitation, personalization of large language models, recommender systems, and optimization.

[comment]: < # Ph.D. Research Internships >

[comment]: < * (Summers'19) I spent summers'20 at the innovative office of [Google Research, Mountain View](https://research.google/) (remotely interned from Urbana due to Covid), where I was mentored by [Dr. Harikrishna Narasimhan](https://research.google/people/106252/) and [Dr. Mahdi Milani Fard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahdi-milani-fard-6924731a1/). >

[comment]: < * (Summers'19) I spent summers'19 at the dynamic office of [Amazon (A9) Research, Palo Alto](https://www.aboutamazon.com/research), where I was mentored by [Dr. Nikhil Rao](https://nikrao.github.io/) and [Dr. Sumeet Katariya](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~sumeet/). >

[comment]: < * (Summers'18) I spent summers'18 at the wonderful office of [Microsoft Research, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I was mentored by [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/) and Dr. Ayush Choure. >

[comment]: <# Prior to Ph.D.>

[comment]: <* (June'15-July'17) I was a member of research staff at [Adobe Research, India](https://research.adobe.com/), where I mostly worked in [time series analysis](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611975321.59) and [recommender systems](http://auai.org/uai2019/proceedings/papers/248.pdf) and also explored many areas including [augmented reality](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8088451/), [natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09335), and visualization (paper to be completed someday). However, all the projects had machine learning in action.>

[comment]: < * (Summers'14) I spent summers'14 at [Adobe Research, India](https://research.adobe.com/), where I worked on building a (recommendation) module that inspires creative artist to initiate new art work. Due to properiotery nature of the system, publishing papers was not easy; however, we filed 2 patents from this work. >

[comment]: <* (Summers'13) At some point, I was really interested in discrete mathematics, especially, combinatorics. For summers 2013, I got a wonderful opportunity to work with [Dr. Jean-Marc Schlenker](http://math.uni.lu/schlenker/) at the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/). Under his guidance, I published my first siginificant [work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195669815001274) in the European Journal of Combinatorics.>
